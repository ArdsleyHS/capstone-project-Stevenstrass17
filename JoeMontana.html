	    <div class="content">Joe Montana was indisputably the greatest QB of all time until Tom Brady came along.  That doesn’t mean that he was any less impressive.  Although his stats don’t show it, he was one of the most dominating players in NFL history, with 4 super bowl wins, including those over powerhouse teams such as the Cowboys, and throwing last minute game winning touchdowns in multiple of these super bowls.  He threw one of the most famous plays in football history, “the catch” and always had a very high passer rating almost every season he played.
